# Game of life

[Game of life ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life)is a zero-player game. It follows two simple rules. 
1. If the cell is alive, then it stays alive if it has either 2 or 3 live neighbors
2. If the cell is dead, then it springs to life only in the case that it has 3 live neighbors
